# Sentiment_Analysis

## unsupervised sentiment analysis
For unsupervised sentiment analysis i used NLTK-VADER: VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, NY Times editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews. This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.
Data : airline tweets
